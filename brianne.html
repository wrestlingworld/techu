		<p>“If you choose a career doing something you love; you’ll never work a day in your life”.</p>

			<p>That is one of my favorite quotes and has helped guide me in my career choices. I am very adaptable to most situations. On one occasion I was doing an assignment for a previous internship working on a never-ending excel sheet when I was told we’re moving floors. So I helped in moving and then once we were settled I assigned an additional task to the first one. I was able to prioritize and complete all the work that was needed to be done.</p>

			<p>I have been told that I am a great public speaker based on how I feed off of the energy of my audience. If I notice them nodding, I’ll liven it up and I try to use simple terms that everyone knows to show respect and dignify my listeners. Although I’m a great speaker I’m an even better listener. I try not to listen to answer but instead understand and hopefully help in resolving any issues that person may be having in that moment if need be. I love to use humor not only to break the ice but in heated moments (at the right time), or when someone is down.</p>
