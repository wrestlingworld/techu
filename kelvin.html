		<p>A growing professional who always seeks to learn. I'm currently a student in Year Up, a national non-profit workforce training program. I'm looking to expand my knowledge of computers and IT to someday work in the field of quality assurance. I believe that my ability to work well with others, my collaborative attitude, and my experience with customer service has helped me grow into the man I am today.</p>

		<p>I was introduced to the world of IT while I was still in high school, and I was inspired to learn more about the field. At the time I was not very knowledgeable about technology, but I was determined to get better. Finding the Year Up program has been a few important point in my life, and today I am happy to say that I have grown as a business person and as a technical person. I am still growing, hoping to go into the field of data analysis after I leave Year Up. </p>
