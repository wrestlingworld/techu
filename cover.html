		<p>Whether someone calls it wrestling or sports entertainment, the men who put on a show in the ring do what few are willing to do. The training and determination that those men and women have goes beyond what many other have. While there are people who have their reasons for not enjoying a wrestling match, there is a spectacle that fans of all ages are drawn to. </p>

	<p>And wrestling isn't a local concept. While some of the largest companies and most popular figures are located in the United States, the spectacle is present all over the world. Japan and Mexico are two major wrestling powerhouses, bringing some of the most popular names in the business to the foreground. Many wrestlers who work in the United States have spoken about their time wrestling in places are far as the United Kingdom and even in India. While many territories and countries have developed their own style, they all share the same basics. </p>

		<p> But now there are more types of wrestling matches. These rules change the rules of the match in several ways. The number of participants may have changed, or maybe the rules needed to win are changed. Many of these matches add a new level of excitement and complexity to an otherwise normal match, and several popular wrestlers have made careers out of competing in other match types. </p>
