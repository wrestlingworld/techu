		<p>The two skills that everyone should start learning are technology and business communications because these skills are increasingly needed in the future. Business communications is important because business is essentially everywhere. Many people probably heard of the phrase that business is everywhere, but most don’t realize the true extent of it. Some would question whether a doctor would need to know business or how the concept of business would concern a Soccer player or even a pilot since they don’t need to know the fundamentals of business to do their jobs. </p>

		<p>However, although these three professions may not have anything in common, business is actually the one thing that they all have in common. Even if the three professions don’t need to have the knowledge of how to run a business, these three professions are funded through business concepts. Businesses range from selling products like socks to building teams for the NBA. Whenever there are transactions, business exists. Hence, it is so important for people to learn how to communicate effectively because all occupations are under some sort of business or organization. In this project we will create a website that teaches youth these important skills so they are prepared to take on the workforce. </p>
